# "Pixel Island" with Cordova and ReactJS
 
This application was created as part of a BCs Computer Science Dissertation at Keele University. 

The technologies used were Cordova and React JS, along with the standard we stack of HTML/JavaScript/CSS.

The application was a proof-of-concept of a gamified to-do list that would aid users in completing boring tasks by making them seem more fun through the power of games and gamification.

The current application allowed users to manage their tasks through a to-do list by specifying their task, description and a difficulty level. The difficulty level would determine how much in-game money the user would receive on its completion. The in-game currency would then be used inside a city-building game, concept shots of which can also be seen below.
